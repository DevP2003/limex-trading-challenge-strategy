## 1. Trading Methodology
I used a fundamentals-first approach. The focus was on identifying companies with strong earnings, revenue growth, and financial health. I manually reviewed price history and statistics available in the Limex platform along with financial data from public sources (Yahoo Finance, earnings reports, etc.).  

---

## 2. Hypothesis & Research Process
**Hypothesis:** Companies with solid earnings and revenue growth would outperform in the short term, especially after quarterly earnings releases.  

**Research Steps:**
- Reviewed quarterly earnings (revenue, profit, growth).  
- Checked stock price performance before and after past earnings.  
- Focused on healthcare and niche sectors where growth potential was strong.

## 3. Data Sources
- Yahoo Finance for historical prices and company fundamentals  
- Company earnings reports  
- Statistics provided in the Limex platform

## 4. Backtesting, Optimization, and Validation
Since this was a short 30-day challenge, I didnâ€™t run full historical backtests. Instead, I:  
- Looked at how my selected stocks had reacted to past earnings cycles.  
- Confirmed that concentrating on HROW (with partial positions in HIMS and CARS) had historically been favorable in similar timeframes.  

---

## 5. Results & Conclusions
- **+4.7% portfolio return** achieved.  
- Concentration in HROW was the main driver of performance.  
- Finished 3rd overall out of 108 participants.  
- Strategy validated the short-term earnings momentum hypothesis.

- **Return:** +4.7%  
- **Sharpe Ratio:** 1.32  
- **Total Trades:** 8  
- **Win/Loss Ratio:** 6 wins, 2 losses

## 7. Lessons Learned & Improvements
- While a concentrated portfolio worked here, broader diversification could reduce volatility in the future.  
- More systematic backtesting across multiple quarters would improve confidence.  
- Could enhance analysis with additional financial ratios (P/E, debt/equity, cash flow).  
- Incorporating technical indicators alongside fundamentals may refine timing.

## Conclusion
The strategy was built on earnings momentum and strong fundamentals. Even without complex automation or API integration, this disciplined, conviction-based approach produced consistent results in a competitive environment.
